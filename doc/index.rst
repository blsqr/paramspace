Welcome!
========

This is the documentation of the :py:mod:`paramspace` package.

It currently is very much *Work in Progress*; in its current state, it only contains an API reference.

In the meantime, refer to the `README on the project page <https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/yunus/paramspace#the-paramspace-package>`_ for installation instructions, example usage, and development information.

.. note::

    If you find any errors in this documentation or would like to contribute to the project, a visit to the `project page <https://ts-gitlab.iup.uni-heidelberg.de/yunus/paramspace>`_ is appreciated.
